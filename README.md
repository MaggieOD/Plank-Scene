# Plank-Scene
This will be an early level. I've included an image to show what the full scene should look like. Then broken it down to background, left platform and right platform. The characters need to make their way across the gap and push the plank in place, so the others can cross. Maybe Boxy stands on top of Hoggy, and jumps across?
